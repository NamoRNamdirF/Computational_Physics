Modeling the three-body problem 
Input coordinates are formed into an array where the first line is the coordinates of the first particle, the second line is the coordinates of the second particle, etc.
The arrays of initial velocities and masses are organized in a similar way. A numerical method for solving the Cauchy problem for differential equations - Verlet's algorithm.
